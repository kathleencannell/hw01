I am excited to start research with Professor Waldo Johnson Jr. of SSA.

I love music and concerts of all kinds. Last year I got to see Clairo, Logic, Khalid, and [Dominic Fike](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sMYcubNOrPs), along with a few smaller shows.
I also enjoy reading, knitting, and being outside.
